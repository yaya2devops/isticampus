# Amal was a good classmate.

### I am aware of her valuable contributions to my journey.

### When I attend lectures, I just want to listen and ponder.

### I rarely took notes.

## She does 

### She always shares them with me so I can capture all and feel comfortable about my understanding of the subject at hand post session.

### She is also a great photographer; she has taken many impressive photos that I admire.

### And.. She took the pictures that are now part of this campus navigator.

## The [fourth slide](https://isticampus.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/navigator/3-get-in-library.png) is her creation.

### She [volunteered that content just here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaya2devops/isticampus/main/assets/ack-classmate.jpg)
